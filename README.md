## Installation

1.  Upload `wasabi-direct-uploader.php` to a PHP-enabled server.
2.  Access it via HTTPS.
3.  Protect it from public indexing.

## Configuration

Edit the CONFIG section in the PHP file:

``` php
$WASABI_REGION = '';
$WASABI_BUCKET = '';
$AWS_ACCESS_KEY = '';
$AWS_SECRET_KEY = '';
$CDN_BASE = '';
$EXPIRES_SECONDS = 3600;
$ALLOW_MIME = [];

$ADD_RANDOM_PREFIX = true;
```

Login configuration:

``` php
define('USERNAME', 'admin');
define('PASSWORD', 'Admin@123');
```

> `PASSWORD` can be stored as plain text or as a secure hash generated by `password_hash()`. You can generate both using [Init Password Generator](https://en.inithtml.com/init-password-generator/).

2.  Open the tool in your browser.
